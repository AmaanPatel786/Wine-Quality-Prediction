# Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using machine learning algorithms in Python. The goal is to build a model that can predict the quality score of wine, helping in quality control in the wine industry.

## Project Overview

The dataset used in this project consists of various physicochemical attributes of wine, such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, and others, with the target variable being the quality of the wine (a score from 0 to 10).

### The Steps Taken:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and scaling the features for better model performance.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Selected the most relevant features that contribute significantly to the prediction.
3. **Model Building**: Implemented multiple machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- Seaborn

## Results

The model was able to predict wine quality based on the input features with high accuracy. You can explore and modify the code to experiment with other machine learning models or further improve the model performance.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
